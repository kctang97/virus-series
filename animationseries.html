    <h2>Virus series #1, Iphone capture and Digital barcode, 2020</h2>
    <p>This is a capture of an Augmented Reality project I made using the iPhone.</p>
    <p>It is the very first project I made in AR.</p>
    <p>The project reflects on the current health crisis we are living in this period.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, it helps to visualize the virus in a different reality and act on to stay away from the virus.</p>

        <h3> Animation 345, 1920 x 1080, Digtal Animation, 3 min 45 sec, 2020</h3>
        <p>  The animation is a series I am creating specifically for the period we live in now.</p>
        <p>  In this series, I am using both After Effect and Photoshop for the entire series due to my artist practice.</p>
        <p>  The content of this is to explore the emotion and reaction of people from everyday news reports I seem on the television and network.</p>
        <p>  Also, the perspective of people like me viewing this health crisis.</p>
        <p>  The reason I called it Animation 345 is because I want the length of this animation to be the actual day,</p>
        <p>  which is 345 days. Pretend when a disaster like the animation shows, or the crisis we live in now.</p>
        <p>  The duration of the crisis can end quickly, like the length of this video 345 days.</p>
        <p>  If countries from all over the world work together, accept each other's efforts in solving the crisis.</p>
        <p>  The crisis now and the crisis in the future will be less pain, less depressing,</p>
        <p>  and less stressful for everyone compare to what happened up to this period.</p>

    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <h2>
      <p> My art practice explores new media while incorporating the knowledge and skills I learned from the university. </p>
      <p> During the process of making my digital art pieces, I began to realize my goals as a digital artist. </p>
      <p> I like to explore the things that I commonly pay less attention to, like the projects I have done for Art 75 and 74 as a beginner.</p>
      <p> However, I create works based on curiosity and interest in a medium and how it affects others differently.</p>
      <p> My inspirations are composed of flashes I see in my imagination.</p>
      <p> It may come from the news, events that I experienced, or the emotion of a memory. </p>
      <p> But, I want to create something personal with my perspective of the world. Because I never know I would be a digital artist one day,</p>
      <p> so I am producing much of my projects while exploring the varieties of digital mediums such as Adobe series Photoshop, Premiere, </p>
      <p> After Effect, Illustrator, and a 3D modeling software Blender. </p>
      <p> Therefore, the projects I had done in 2019 - 2020, implement the personal elements and events that I experienced in my projects. </p>
      <p> They are my concept of art and mostly build on top of the concepts that arise in my brain.</p>
      <p> The contents collect from the observation from my surrounding environment. </p>
      <p> I continue to develop my digital style with input from class critiques and lessons from classes. </p>
      <p> The goal of my projects is mostly to experiment with different media that I am not familiar with and use them to express my emotional world and my ideology.</p>

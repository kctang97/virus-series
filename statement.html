    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <h2><p> My art practice explores new media while incorporating the knowledge and skills I learned from my SJSU classes. </p>
        <p> During the process of making my digital art pieces, I began to realize my goals. </p>
        <p> I like to explore the things that we commonly pay less attention to like the projects I have done in Art 75 and 74.</p>
        <p> However, I create works based on curiosity and interest in a medium and how it affects others differently. </p>
        <p> My inspirations are composed from flashes I see in my imagination. It may come from the news, events that I experienced, or the emotion of a memory. </p>
        <p> But, I want to create something personal with my perspective of the world. </p>
        <p> Therefore, the projects I have done in 2019, I have implemented personal elements and events that I experienced in my projects as an experiment.</P>
        <p> I continue to develop my digital style with the input from critiques and lessons from classes.</P>
        <p> The goal of my projects are mostly to experiment with different media that I am not familiar with and use them to express my emotional world and my ideology.</P>
